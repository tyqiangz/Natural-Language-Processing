Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.\\nBorn and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump attended Fordham University for two years and received a bachelor\\'s degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He became president of his father Fred Trump\\'s real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations to building or renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He owned the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice from 2004 to 2015.\\nTrump\\'s political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise electoral college victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist.\\nDuring his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy\\'s third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but has failed to repeal and replace the ACA as a whole. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) and withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed import tariffs which triggered a trade war with China, moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria. He met three times with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, downplayed the threat, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, and promoted false information about unproven treatments and the availability of testing.\\nA special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign benefited from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump solicited Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, the House of Representatives impeached him in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020.\\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden but refused to concede defeat. He has made unsubstantiated accusations of electoral fraud, mounted a series of unsuccessful legal challenges to the results, and initially ordered government officials not to cooperate in the presidential transition.\\nContents\\n1 Personal life\\n1.1 Early life\\n1.2 Family\\n1.3 Religion\\n1.4 Health\\n1.5 Wealth\\n2 Business career\\n2.1 Real estate\\n2.2 Branding and licensing\\n2.3 Legal affairs and bankruptcies\\n2.4 Side ventures\\n2.5 Foundation\\n2.6 Conflicts of interest\\n3 Media career\\n3.1 Books\\n3.2 WWF/WWE\\n3.3 The Apprentice\\n3.4 Acting\\n3.5 Talk shows\\n4 Political career\\n4.1 Political activities up to 2015\\n4.2 2016 presidential campaign\\n5 Presidency (2017–present)\\n5.1 Early actions\\n5.2 Domestic policy\\n5.3 Immigration\\n5.4 Foreign policy\\n5.5 Personnel\\n5.6 Impeachment\\n5.7 COVID-19 pandemic\\n5.8 Investigations\\n5.9 Judiciary\\n5.10 2020 presidential election\\n6 Public profile\\n6.1 Approval ratings\\n6.2 Social media\\n6.3 False statements\\n6.4 Promotion of conspiracy theories\\n6.5 Relationship with the press\\n6.6 Racial views\\n6.7 Misogyny and allegations of sexual assault and misconduct\\n6.8 Allegations of inciting violence\\n6.9 Popular culture\\n6.10 Recognition\\n7 Notes\\n8 References\\n8.1 Works cited\\n9 External links\\nPersonal life\\nEarly life\\n1964 New York Military Academy yearbook photo\\nTrump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City.\\nMilitary deferment\\nWhile in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments.\\nFamily\\nMain article: Family of Donald Trump\\nFurther information: Trump family\\nParents and siblings\\nMain articles: Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump\\nFred Trump started working in real estate with his mother Elizabeth when he was 15, after his father Friedrich had died in the 1918 flu pandemic.\\nWives and children\\nTrump is sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Roberts on January 20, 2017.

Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump\\'s wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.\\nTrump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.\\nTrump\\'s tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion over the ten-year period, in contrast to his claims about his financial health and business abilities.

Trump began to purchase significant blocks of shares in various public companies, leading some observers to think he was engaged in the practice called greenmail, or feigning the intent to acquire the companies and then pressuring management to repurchase the buyer\\'s stake at a premium. The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".\\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the defunct Eastern Air Lines shuttle, with 21 planes and landing rights in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. He financed the purchase with $380 million from 22 banks, rebranded the operation the Trump Shuttle, and operated it until 1992.

The number \"five\" includes the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. Despite their similarities, some of these five elections had peculiar results; e.g. John Quincy Adams trailed in both the national popular vote and the electoral college in 1824 (since no one had a majority in the electoral college, Adams was chosen by the House of Representatives), and Samuel Tilden in 1876 remains the only losing candidate to win an actual majority of the popular vote (rather than just a plurality).\\n^ \\nReferences\\n^\\na b Peter, Josh (November 5, 2020). \"Joe Biden will become the oldest president in American history, a title previously held by Ronald Reagan\".

    "The Wandering Earth, described as China’s first big-budget science fiction thriller, quietly made it onto screens at AMC theaters in North America this weekend, and it shows a new side of Chinese filmmaking — one focused toward futuristic spectacles rather than China’s traditionally grand, massive historical epics. At the same time, The Wandering Earth feels like a throwback to a few familiar eras of American filmmaking. While the film’s cast, setting, and tone are all Chinese, longtime science fiction fans are going to see a lot on the screen that reminds them of other movies, for better or worse.\n",
